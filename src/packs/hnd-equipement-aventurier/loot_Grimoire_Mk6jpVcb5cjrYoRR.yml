      <p>Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100
      blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.</p>

      <p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect
      the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual
      breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might
      find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell
      recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty
      tome in an ancient library.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p>

      <p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to
      your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can
      spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your
      spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then
      deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it.
      You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures
      required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own
      notation.&nbsp;For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and
      costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you
      experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need
      to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the
      spell just like your other spells.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for
      example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just
      like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since
      you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell.
      You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied
      spell.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to
      transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling
      out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do
      so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a
      safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation
      of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might
      be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from
      your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient
      library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you
      lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>
